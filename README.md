### This is a copy of instagram made with Laravel and VueJS

### Install and run

To install you can just run "yarn" inside the folder after cloning the repository<br>
After that you need to provide a database to run. I used PostgreSQL in development.

To run the app just run php artisan serve

You can run in heroku, but uploads will not work because of local storage. It would need to use Amazon S3 or something like it.<br>
But you can test anyway at least the authentication here: [freecodegram-andreszlima.herokuapp.com](freecodegram-andreszlima.herokuapp.com)
